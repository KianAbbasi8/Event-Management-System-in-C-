Event Management System in C++

A simple console-based C++ application that allows users to add, view, search, update, and delete event records.
The project demonstrates the use of file handling, structures, and functions to manage and store data efficiently.

Features:

Add new events with details like name, date, place, and organizer.

View all stored events in a clean format.

Search for a specific event by name.

Update existing event details.

Delete events from the file.

Persistent data storage using text files.

Concepts Used:

Structures (struct) – To store related data (event details).

File Handling (fstream) – To read/write data from files.

Functions – For modular and reusable code.

Switch-case & Loops – For menu-driven control.

String and Stringstream – For text and data parsing.

How It Works:

The program runs in the console (terminal).

The user selects an option from the menu.

Data is stored in events.txt file in comma-separated format.

The program reads or modifies this file as needed.
